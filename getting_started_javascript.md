### Introduction

In this guide, you'll cover the basics of JavaScript specifically for back-end development with Node.js. Basic concepts in JavaScript are universal, but weâ€™ll skip aspects focused on the browser and DOM manipulation.

### Variables

Variables store data values that we can use and manipulate in our code.

#### Syntax
```javascript
// Declaring variables
let name = "John";      // Block-scoped
const age = 25;         // Block-scoped, immutable
var isActive = true;    // Function-scoped (legacy)
